Basically only made variable one hyperparameter while the 
others remain static. 
Also tried this with different cluster_min / max and eps for 
the clustering algorithm

Best experiment was Experiment_5 with increase in MOTA of 0.314

Experiment_5 focused on match_thresh variation from 0.7 to 0.45
on eps=0.07 with cluster_min=3, cluster_max=25

Other tries:
Experiment_4 MOTA increase: 0.018
    0.7 to 0.5 with eps=0.05,  cluster_min/max = 3/10

Experiment_3 MOTA increase: 0.116
    0.7 to 0.5 with eps=0.055, cluster_min/max = 3/10

Experiment_2 MOTA increase: 0.187
    0.7 to 0.5 with eps=0.06,  cluster_min/max = 3/10
